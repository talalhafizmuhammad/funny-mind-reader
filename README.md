# 🧠 Funny Mind Reader

**A hilarious and fully responsive mind-reading web app** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It pretends to scan your brain using "neural networks" and then magically tells you the number you were thinking — which is, of course, the one you entered. 😉

> 🪄 _"How did it know?!" — You (every time you try it)_

## 🎯 What It Does

This app is a **fun parody** of AI and mind-reading tools. It:

1. Prompts the user to think of a number between **1 and 100**.
2. Pretends to process it using "neural networks" (with fun animations).
3. Dramatically reveals:  
   > “You are thinking of the number: **X**”  
   (where X is the same number the user entered 😆)

Perfect as an ice-breaker, portfolio piece, or UI/UX showcase!
